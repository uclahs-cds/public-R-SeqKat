Description: Kataegis is a localized hypermutation occurring when a region is enriched in somatic SNVs. Kataegis can result from multiple cytosine deaminations catalyzed by the AID/APOBEC family of proteins. This package contains functions to detect kataegis from SNVs in BED format. This package reports two scores per kataegic event, a hypermutation score and an APOBEC mediated kataegic score.
